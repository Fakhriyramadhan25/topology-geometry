# Geometry and Topology Analysis

This repository serve the function for geometry and topology analysis. There are two classes inside the file, Geometry and Topology. 
Geometry class has methods to check all the possibility of geometry error whilst Topology class merely for converting from coordinate point to topology data structure.

In the repository there are two main files.
1. Topology.ipybn - for experimenting 
2. Topology_BPN.ipybn - for implementation
